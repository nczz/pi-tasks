# Development Rules

## Product Goal

Build a Pi-native task and progress contract that lets both the agent and the user understand:

- what is being implemented,
- why it is being implemented,
- current progress and blockers,
- acceptance criteria,
- verification evidence,
- user decisions,
- and whether the task is truly complete.

This project must align with the commercial-quality bar established by `pi-knowledge`: verified behavior, clear docs, release gates, and no misleading claims.

## Architecture Baseline

- Target runtime: Pi coding agent extension system.
- Primary state should be Pi session-aware and branch-aware.
- The extension should use Pi-native APIs before external protocols:
  - `registerTool`
  - `registerCommand`
  - `appendEntry`
  - `setLabel`
  - `ctx.ui.setWidget`
  - `ctx.ui.setStatus`
  - lifecycle events such as `session_start`, `session_tree`, `turn_end`, and `session_shutdown`
- MCP or Markdown export can be added later, but should not replace the Pi-native core.

## Implementation Rules

- TypeScript strict mode.
- ESM only.
- No `any` unless the boundary truly requires it and the rationale is documented.
- Keep startup light. Avoid loading optional UI-heavy modules at extension import time unless Pi requires them.
- Prefer deterministic local state transitions over prompt-only behavior.
- All agent-facing tools must have clear `promptSnippet` and `promptGuidelines`.
- Long-running operations must support cancellation where applicable.
- TUI custom renderers and widgets must be width-safe and tested in real Pi TUI sessions.

## Product Rules

- This is not just a todo list.
- Every active task must be able to answer:
  - objective,
  - current status,
  - next action,
  - acceptance criteria,
  - verification evidence,
  - unresolved user decisions,
  - and completion confidence.
- The system must not mark work complete without verification evidence.
- The agent may propose task changes, but user-facing decisions must be recorded explicitly.

## Verification Rules

Before claiming readiness:

- Run unit tests.
- Run `node --experimental-strip-types -e "import('./index.ts')"`.
- Run `npm pack --dry-run`.
- Run Pi dogfood with at least:
  - task creation,
  - task update,
  - `/tasks` command,
  - session resume,
  - branch/fork behavior if implemented,
  - and `/quit` clean exit.

Skipped gates must be reported as skipped, not passed.

## Documentation Rules

- Behavior contracts belong in `AGENTS.md`.
- User-facing capabilities belong in `README.md`.
- Product and architecture planning belongs in `docs/`.
- Release process must be documented before the first npm release.
